# annoops - Operands as annotated functions for JavaScript

`annoops` provides basic operands (+, -, etc.) as functions for JavaScript. The functions have been [annotated](https://github.com/annojs/annotate) and provide nice runtime errors. This might have a slight effect on performance, though, but I believe the convenience is worth it.
